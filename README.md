<h1>README</h1>
<li>This project scrapes data from GitHubâ€™s REST API to collect information about users in Sydney with over 100 followers and their most recent repositories, organizing it into structured CSV files for further analysis.</li>
<li>The analysis revealed that a significant percentage of Sydney-based developers actively contribute to repositories without a designated license, which could impact project reuse.</li>
<li>Developers are recommended to prioritize selecting an appropriate license for their repositories to increase visibility and potential collaboration opportunities in the open-source community.</li>
