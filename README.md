This project scrapes data from GitHubâ€™s REST API to collect information about users in Sydney with over 100 followers and their most recent repositories, organizing it into structured CSV files for further analysis.
The analysis revealed that a significant percentage of Sydney-based developers actively contribute to repositories without a designated license, which could impact project reuse.
Developers are recommended to prioritize selecting an appropriate license for their repositories to increase visibility and potential collaboration opportunities in the open-source community.
